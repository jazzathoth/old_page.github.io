		<h3>Eclipse Integrated Development Environment</h3>
		<p>
			I am a fairly dedicated Linux user. I have preferred Ubuntu with the Unity desktop for any serious 
			work pretty much since it was first released back in 2012. My only functional copy of Windows is 8.1 on
			a small Atom powered tablet. Unfortunately, the main IDE maintained by ARM, Keil MDK, is only
			available for Windows. There are two alternatives, both of which are just plugins for the Eclipse IDE:
			System Workbench for STM32, and GNU MCU Eclipse. Eclipse works great with Ubuntu, and I had used it
			before for some basic C and C++ development/debugging. I started out with System Workbench since I 
			found the most documentation on forums and YouTube.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eclipse is a free open source IDE, modules can be downloaded to support almost any programming language.
			I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this site using the Web Tools Platform plugin on Eclipse.
		</p>
		<h3>System Workbench</h3>
		<p>
			The System Workbench plugin is built specifically for STMicro's ARM processors and also has extensive
			definitions for STMicro based development boards. It utilizes the CMSIS libraries from ARM and the
			CubeHAL library from STMicro. It exclusively uses the STlinkV2 or V2-1 debugger.
		</p>
		<h3>GNU MCU Eclipse</h3>
		<p>
			GNU MCU Eclipse plugin supports a much wider range of target processors than System Workbench. This 
			includes ARM processors from all the manufacturers for which libraries are available, as well as
			RISC-V, and Freescale. It also supports a wider array of debugging tools, as well as debugging with 
			the qemu emulator.

		<h3>The GNU ARM toolchain</h3>
		<p>
			The ARM toolchain is part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) project. There are several other more specialized toolchains
			including Linaro, but pretty much all the functional toolchains for ARM are based on this.
			Keil MDK uses this toolchain, System Workbench uses this tool chain, GNU MCU Eclipse uses this 
			toolchain, although it can be swapped out in the latter.
