		<h3>About</h3>
		
		<p>I am building this site as both a portfolio, as a sort of repository for my projects, and in some instances to provide information for others working on similar projects. I have definitely benefited from the sitesâ€™ of other folks that were made for the same reason, particularly in the instance of my motorcycle projects. While working on my ARM microcontroller projects, I discovered there was precious little information online for people trying to get started with these systems, and I had to rely on factory manuals. While there is a much steeper learning curve for these devices, they are cheap and powerful and I believe more hobbyists and enthusiasts would make use of them if there was a good place to go for information on getting started.  </p>
		<p>While this site was started as a portfolio for internship applications, I think I will eventually be adding sections for some other things such as some of my art, my motorcycle projects, and maybe even a blog or short essay section eventually. As such this is a work in progress. The portfolio section will be the most developed initially, and other pages will be added along the way.</p>

				I started learning ARM Cortex development on Cortex M3 chips made by ST Micro.
				Arm Cortex microcontrollers are a more modern and more complex microcontroller architecture than AVR,PIC, or many of the other common microcontrollers available at non-commercial prices.
				The Cortex M3 is a 32 bit microcontroller available from numerous manufacturers often with a full System-On-Chip like array of peripherals.

				AVR/Arduino is a nice easy way to get started learning about microcontrollers and 
				bare metal development. This is where I started.
