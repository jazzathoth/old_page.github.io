		<h3>Debuging and Flashing Hardware</h3>
		<p>
			I have so far used four different methods of flashing and debugging my Cortex M microcontrollers.
			STMicro's Cortex M3 chips all use Serial Wire Debug (a single wire JTAG interface) as the primary 
			method to debug and upload software into the chip's main memory. The STM32F1xx chips also have at 
			least two other ways of writing to the flash memory from a computer: Serial and USB.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I said in the developer tools section, I am running Ubuntu Linux on my primary development machine,
			which had some effect on the tools I could use here as well. Initially, the STlink-V2 worked fine
			with Eclipse and OpenOCD, but after a few days and a few hundred flashes, it began to throw errors
			when I tried connecting. Initially I thought the knockoff STlink-V2 hardware had failed, but after
			the same thing happened to a second one, I began to suspect something else was wrong. That was when I
			began exploring other options. I was able to upload via Serial using the FTDI USB to UART. Flashing
			a Maple bootloader enabled flashing over USB with the "dfu-util" software. And eventually I got 
			Black Magic Probe firmware on one of my STlink-V2's.

		<h3>STlink-V2</h3>
		<div class="imgBoxMulti">
			<img alt="stMicto" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/stlinkv2_1.jpg">
			<div><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">STlink-V2 Serial Wire Debugger</p></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			There are a number of ways of getting your binary on to the chip. For the STM32f103 devices, and pretty
			much all Cortex M chips from STMicro, the manufacturer sells a proprietary debugger called the STlink.
			It comes in several versions, the most common and well supported being the STlink-V2. There are 
			off-shore clones of this available on Amazon and AliExpress for a few dollars each. These use the 
			Serial Wire Debug JTAG interface to both flash and debug the microcontrollers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The main advantage of the STlink-V2 is that most of the IDE's directly support flashing and debugging
			over this interface.  "Keil MDK", which is a Windows only development environment produced by ARM, and
			"System Workbench for STM32", an open-source Eclipse IDE plugin for STMicro chips, and 
			"GNU MCU Eclipse," another less specialized Eclipse plugin for embedded software development, all 
			all support STlink. Another similar proprietary JTAG debugger called J-Link is also widely 
			supported. All Linux based implementations of these devices use the program OpenOCD (OCD = 
			On Chip Debugger).
		</p>
		<p>
			I was initially running System Workbench and a few days after receiving my first STlink-V2 from
			Amazon, OpenOCD began throwing an error claiming it was seeing the wrong device. For some reason
			the USB device numbers didn't match. OpenOCD appeared to be using the config file for a newer version
			of the STlink (STlinkV2-1 instead of STlinkV2; V2-1 supported full JTAG, V2 just supported SWD). 
			Changing the config file, however, only threw a new error. I assumed it was a hardware issue and 
			ordered a new one. The new STlink worked for 3 days before it began to throw the same error. After
			digging through lots of config files and online forums, I am suspicious it is related to Ubuntu's 
			udev configuration, but so far I haven't been able to make it work again. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The thing I like most about these little programmers is that each one contains a whole STM32F1xx 
			processor, making them very versatile and hackable. When the metal cover is removed, there are four
			little contacts on the side left over from programming at the factory which connect directly to the
			SWD and power pins on the chip. I took advantage of this by turning one in to a Black Magic Probe,
			but there are so many more things that could be done with one of these. Unfortunately only a few pins
			are actually connected, but it is still a fairly powerful processor in a conveniently tiny package.
			This warrants a future project.

		<h3>Serial Flashing</h3>
		<div class="imgBoxMulti">
			<img alt="ftdi ft232r" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/ftdi232_1.jpg">
			<div><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">FTDI USB UART</p></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Another option is to use a serial interface. Most of STMicro's Cortex M3's ship with a bootloader in
			read-only memory that, when activated via pulling up a dedicated boot pin, will enable serial access 
			to the main program memory over the first USART. I was able to use an FTDI FT232R USB to UART to upload
			binaries. Unfortunately, that is all you can do with this interface, it doesn't appear any on chip 
			debugging is available without JTAG.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can be a great solution if all you need to do is flash your files, and if you have the right
			chip, it may be compatible with the Arduino IDE. I was able to upload a "blinkey" program from 
			Arduino over FTDI. I don't want to use the Arduino IDE to develop for my Cortex M3 projects however,
			due to it's severe limitations compared to the standard STMicro libraries. There is also no built in
			support for flashing this way in any of the other IDEs for Cortex chips. Also, uploading anything 
			outside the Arduino IDE requires one of several python script uploaders such as
			<a href="https://github.com/jsnyder/stm32loader">JSnyder's STM32loader.</a>

		<h3>USB Direct Firmware Uploader</h3>
		<div class="imgBoxMulti">
			<img alt="stMicro" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/usbDfu_1.jpg">
			<div><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">FTDI USB UART</p></div>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			A third option - once again only for flashing programs - is to directly use the microcontroller's USB
			interface. This requires a custom bootloader type program to be flashed to the main memory and any 
			uploaded programs to share the main program memory. It isn't a real time operating system though, 
			since there is no kernel between your program and the hardware. It is just a simple program that 
			initializes the USB peripheral and enables access to the flash memory. It also requires a program
			called "dfu-util" on the computer used to upload the software.
		</p>
		<p>
			This method is also compatible with the Arduino IDE, because Arduino supports the Maple development
			boards from which the DFU bootloader is derived. Once again, there is no support for this system in
			any of the other IDEs so all flashing needs to be done through a terminal. The advantage here is that
			the boot jumper does not need to be reset.
		</p>
		<h4>&#9642Note</h4>
		<p style="padding-left: 25px; font-size: 10pt;">
			For the blue "Minimum System Development Board" from Amazon or Ali Express like the one I am using
			here, a 1.5K pullup resistor is required on pin A12 (USB D+). Both boards I have have a 10K resistor
			instead. A 2.2K in parallel with the 10K seems to work (1/((1/10K)+(1/2.2K)) =~ 1.8K).

		<h3>Black Magic Probe</h3>
		<div class="imgBoxMulti">
			<img alt="black magic probe" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/stlinkv2_4.jpg">
			<img alt="stlikn swd contacts" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/stlinkv2_2.jpg">
			<div><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">STlink-V2 dongle BMP hack</p></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			The final option that I used is an open-source utility called "Black Magic Probe." This is a piece of
			software that uploads a dedicated GNU Debugger host on a Cortex M chip and allows direct debugging
			including, theoretically, access to all the registers on the target device and running through the
			code step by step. Unfortunately, this is rather new and doesn't always work perfectly. The Black 
			Magic Probe software can be downloaded from 
			<a href="https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic">Black Magic Probe Github.</a> run make in the top 
			level directory and then in ./src run"make clean" and "make PROBE_HOST=stlink".
		</p>
		<p>
			The STlink-V2 is nothing more than a STM32f10x (I have 2, one was a 101 the other a 102) chip
			on a USB dongle set up like the Atmel AtTiny85. It has it's 4 Serial Wire Debug pins exposed on one
			side of the PCB. The SWD pins will be Vcc (+3.3V), Vss (Ground/0V), SWDIO (Data), and SWCLK(clock signal).
			SWDIO goes to pin 34 on the chip and SWCLK to pin 37. These are then connected to the corresponding
			pins on another SWD capable device.
		</p>
		<div class="imgBoxMulti">
			<img alt="black magic probe" src="./assets/images/arm/debug/stlinkv2_5.jpg">
			<div><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom:20px;">STlink-V2 SWD pins</p></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			To flash with OpenOcd, create a text file *name*.cfg containing:</br>
			set CHIPNAME STM32F103C8T6 </br>
			source[find interface/stlink-v2.cfg] </br>
			transport select hla_swd </br>
			source [find target/stm32f1xx.cfg] </BR>
			set WORKAREASIZE 0X2000 </br>
			</br>
			Then OpenOCD is run in the blackmagic/src with </br>
			</br>openocd -f *name*.cfg -c'init_reset halt; program blackmagic_dfu.bin 0x800000 verify;reset;exit</br>
		</p>
		<p>
			This installs a DFU bootloader. Now blackmagic.bin can be installed the same way, or over USB with
			dfu-util. If OpenOCD is used again, remove the 0x800000 memory location so that it won't overwrite
			the DFU bootloader. This is required to initialize the USB peripheral, and can make updating the
			firmware easier later.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have had some success getting the Black Magic Probe integrated with the Eclipse IDE. I set up a new
			debug configuration under GDB Hardware Debugging, disable the remote debugger check box and enter all
			of the connection commands in the "Setup" tab in the first box. Reset and Halt are both unchecked. 
			See screenshots below. I have had intermittent success with this method, having the graphical 
			interface in Eclipse streamlines things a lot, but sometimes it's hard to tell what Eclipse is doing
			and getting it configured was a mess.
